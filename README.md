# S-P-Navigator
## S&P Navigator: Time Series Forecasting with Financial Indicators
Develop a time series regression model to predict S&P 500 stock prices.

Implement and analyze technical indicators such as RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence), and Bollinger Bands.

Evaluate prediction performance using different algorithms.

## Technologies Used

Python: Main programming language

Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-Learn: Machine learning models

Statsmodels: Time series modeling

Jupyter Notebook: Interactive coding and analysis



## ðŸ“Š Data Source

Dataset: Historical S&P 500 stock prices from NASDAQ.

Data includes columns like Date, Close, Open, High, Low.

ðŸ“ˆ Technical Indicators

This project implements the following indicators:

RSI (Relative Strength Index)

Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.

Formula: RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + RS))

MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)

Uses two EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) to identify trend direction and momentum.

Components: MACD Line, Signal Line, and Histogram

Bollinger Bands

Consists of a simple moving average (SMA) and upper/lower bands calculated using standard deviations.

Indicates price volatility.
